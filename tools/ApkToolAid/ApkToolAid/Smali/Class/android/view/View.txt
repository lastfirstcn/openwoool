This class represents the basic building block for user interface components. A View occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and event handling. View is the base class for widgets, which are used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). The ViewGroup subclass is the base class for layouts, which are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define their layout properties.

This constant was deprecated in API level 28. The view drawing cache was largely made obsolete with the introduction of hardware-accelerated rendering in API 11. With hardware-acceleration, intermediate cache layers are largely unnecessary and can easily result in a net loss in performance due to the cost of creating and updating the layer. In the rare cases where caching layers are useful, such as for alpha animations, setLayerType(int, android.graphics.Paint) handles this with hardware rendering. For software-rendered snapshots of a small part of the View hierarchy or individual Views it is recommended to create a Canvas from either a Bitmap or Picture and call draw(android.graphics.Canvas) on the View. However these software-rendered usages are discouraged and have compatibility issues with hardware-only rendering features such as Config.HARDWARE bitmaps, real-time shadows, and outline clipping. For screenshots of the UI for feedback reports or unit testing the PixelCopy API is recommended.

This method was deprecated in API level 28. The view drawing cache was largely made obsolete with the introduction of hardware-accelerated rendering in API 11. With hardware-acceleration, intermediate cache layers are largely unnecessary and can easily result in a net loss in performance due to the cost of creating and updating the layer. In the rare cases where caching layers are useful, such as for alpha animations, setLayerType(int, Paint) handles this with hardware rendering. For software-rendered snapshots of a small part of the View hierarchy or individual Views it is recommended to create a Canvas from either a Bitmap or Picture and call draw(Canvas) on the View. However these software-rendered usages are discouraged and have compatibility issues with hardware-only rendering features such as Config.HARDWARE bitmaps, real-time shadows, and outline clipping. For screenshots of the UI for feedback reports or unit testing the PixelCopy API is recommended.

This method was deprecated in API level 28. The view drawing cache was largely made obsolete with the introduction of hardware-accelerated rendering in API 11. With hardware-acceleration, intermediate cache layers are largely unnecessary and can easily result in a net loss in performance due to the cost of creating and updating the layer. In the rare cases where caching layers are useful, such as for alpha animations, setLayerType(int, Paint) handles this with hardware rendering. For software-rendered snapshots of a small part of the View hierarchy or individual Views it is recommended to create a Canvas from either a Bitmap or Picture and call draw(Canvas) on the View. However these software-rendered usages are discouraged and have compatibility issues with hardware-only rendering features such as Config.HARDWARE bitmaps, real-time shadows, and outline clipping. For screenshots of the UI for feedback reports or unit testing the PixelCopy API is recommended.

In the rare cases where caching layers are useful, such as for alpha animations, setLayerType(int, Paint) handles this with hardware rendering. For software-rendered snapshots of a small part of the View hierarchy or individual Views it is recommended to create a Canvas from either a Bitmap or Picture and call draw(Canvas) on the View. However these software-rendered usages are discouraged and have compatibility issues with hardware-only rendering features such as Config.HARDWARE bitmaps, real-time shadows, and outline clipping.

This method was deprecated in API level 28. The view drawing cache was largely made obsolete with the introduction of hardware-accelerated rendering in API 11. With hardware-acceleration, intermediate cache layers are largely unnecessary and can easily result in a net loss in performance due to the cost of creating and updating the layer. In the rare cases where caching layers are useful, such as for alpha animations, setLayerType(int, Paint) handles this with hardware rendering. For software-rendered snapshots of a small part of the View hierarchy or individual Views it is recommended to create a Canvas from either a Bitmap or Picture and call draw(Canvas) on the View. However these software-rendered usages are discouraged and have compatibility issues with hardware-only rendering features such as Config.HARDWARE bitmaps, real-time shadows, and outline clipping. For screenshots of the UI for feedback reports or unit testing the PixelCopy API is recommended.
